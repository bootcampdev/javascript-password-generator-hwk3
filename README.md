# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

# Repository: javascript-password-generator-hwk3
Gather requirements needed to generate a random password

## Your Task

This week’s homework requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Cirtierai and How I Met the Acceptance Criteria

```
A series of prompts for the password criteria.
 - Minimize the number of prompts

 - Provide feedback if the answwer to the prompt is incorrect

 - The criteria are as follows
    1. Length of password, must be between 8 and 128 inclusive.
    2. User selection of the type combination of characters in the password.  This includes lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

When all prompts are answered the password is created and displayed on the screen.
